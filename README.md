# VineyardMap
jVectorMap streetmap of the Vineyard district in LoM.  
This is the readme file. You're welcome.  


Possible Future Updates:    
    Move all data to new (more precise) map.  
    Adjust zoom speed?  
    Somehow make the random ID system more intuitive (make plots updatable by click?)  
    Gather and verify plot information. (ongoing forever, of course!)
